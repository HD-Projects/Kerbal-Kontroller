# Alternative 1

Use a laser cutting service that does the laser cutting for you

     
   Upload the SVG file from the "final" folder to a website such as https://www.ponoko.com/designs (our recommended laser cutting site) and select a material. Next proceed to    checkout and wait for your custom made faceplate to arrive. Note, do nout use a material such as steel or aluminum if you don't have a drill that can cut mounting holes in such a material.

# Alternative 2

Find a makerspace near you and get your item cut

   Open a website such as https://makerspaces.make.co/ to find a local makerspace near you. Then look at the makerspaces website (for our example https://members.10bitworks.com/) to see if they have a laser cutter capable of cutting your plexi. If they do follow the instructions for getting to use the equitpment and once you have secured a time to use the machine upload the svg from the final folder and proceed to get your faceplate cut/engraved.
