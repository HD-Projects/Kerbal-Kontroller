# design.md 

This folder holds all the cad files for the various iterations of the design, v1 is the initial release, v2 is the second release and "final" is the CAD files for the final design 
all the code files and parts are designed for the final version but we kept the last two in there if you want inspiration.

Look in the images folder for hot renders of the controller (so that those 41 hrs of cpu time aren't wasted).
