# Alternative 1 

Use a custom 3d printing service

Use a website such as https://www.3dhubs.com/ https://www.shapeways.com/ https://i.materialise.com/en where you upload an stl file and get it printed and shipped to you. These parts will cost 10-15$ to make so you might consider using alternative 2 if you want to save money

# Alternative 2

find a makerspace near you and get your item printed

   Open a website such as https://makerspaces.make.co/ to find a local makerspace near you. Then look at the makerspaces website (for our example https://members.10bitworks.com/) to see if they have a 3d printer avaliabe for use. If they do follow the instructions for getting to use the equitpment and once you have secured a time to use the machine upload the stl from the 3d-print folder and proceed to get your parts printed.
